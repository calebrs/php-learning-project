# php-learning-project

Project for getting to know PHP. This project includes a simple form that logs data into a database.

# Requirements:

Create an HTML form that uses jQuery to submit the results to a PHP function which uses a SQL query to insert the form results into a fictitious database table.

# Notes

- I created the web app to able to easily add additional routes and forms
- You can use pure PHP to submit the form but it causes a page reload. I use an AJAX request with Jquery instead.
- Generally, if I was to spend more time on the architecture I would get move code to resemble "MVC".
  - Create a "Messages" modal that gets called by a control function.

# Possible TODOS

- Create Simple validation for form
- Create GET route to display DB data
